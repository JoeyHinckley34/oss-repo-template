## Part 3 Why is it important to choose a license?
A license is necessary for telling others what you code is allowed to be used for. If code is posted without a license it prevents other delvepers from using it, as well informed programmers would not want to put themselves at risk. If one decides to not include a license with their posted code others may use it for harmful and or illegal activities and without a license the original writer of the code may be held liable. <br />
