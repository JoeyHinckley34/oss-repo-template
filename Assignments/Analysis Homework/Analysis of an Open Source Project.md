Also, I am hoping to learn Swift this semester, which is not present in this project. |
| Level of Activity | 2 | The only week in the past year without a commit was the week of 10/17/21. Overall very active.|
| Number of Contributors | 2 | [148 Contributors total and 27 listed as still active.](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) |
| Product Size | 1 | Running the command: git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l; Yields 756,092 total lines, which is a large codebase|
| Issue Tracker | 2 | 246 issues open and 2,290 closed. The most recent issue opened 3 days ago, and the most recent issue closed 15 days ago. |
| New Contributor | 2 | There is a whole [page](https://submitty.org/developer) dedicated to new developers coming in.|
| Community Norms | 2 | There is a well-put-together [website](https://submitty.org/index/overview) to welcome users as well as developers. |
| User Base | 2 | I do not need to look far to find many users using this project, as I have used it every year at RPI and many of my peers have as well. The project also has 293 forks and 348 stars which shows quite a large user base.|
| Total Score | 16 | Overall this is an amazing open-source project, with an easy and clear guide for developers to come aboard. I just do not know yet if it is the project for me.|

I want to use this semester as an opportunity to learn Swift which is not present in this project. |
| Level of Activity | 2 | A massive number of commits a week. Averaging 300+ commits every week with the lowest in the past year being 184. |
| Number of Contributors | 2 | There are 3062 total contributors listed on Github, which is a very large community of contributors. |
| Product Size | 1 | Running the command: git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l; Yields 6 different totals which in total sum to 5,849,416, which is a massive codebase.|
| Issue Tracker | 2 | There are 2,340 open issues and 31,642 closed. The most recent open was 1 hour ago and the most recent closed was 11 hours ago. Just about as active as you can be. |
| New Contributor | 2 | There is a tab on their [website](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/code) dedicated to welcoming new contributors.|
| Community Norms | 2 | There is a professional [website](https://www.tensorflow.org) dedicated to this project.|
| User Base | 2 | There are 176,063 users listed on github, also 86.3k forks and 163k stars. This shows just how wide spread this project is  |
| Total Score | 16 |This project is far too big for me to become a part of. It will take me a while to understand how to use tensorflow, and even long to be able to contribute any meaningful feature to the source code. |
