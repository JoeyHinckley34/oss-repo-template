| Level of Activity | 2 | The only week in the past year without a commit was the week of 10/17/21. Overall very active.|
| Number of Contributors | 2 | [148 Contributors total and 27 listed as still active.](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) |
| Product Size | 1 | Running the command: git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l; Yields 756,092 total lines, which is a large codebase|
| Issue Tracker | 2 | 246 issues open and 2,290 closed. The most recent issue opened 3 days ago, and the most recent issue closed 15 days ago. |

| Community Norms | 2 | There is a well-put-together [website](https://submitty.org/index/overview) to welcome users as well as developers. |
| User Base | 2 | I do not need to look far to find many users using this project, as I have used it every year at RPI and many of my peers have as well. The project also has 293 forks and 348 stars which shows quite a large user base.|
| Total Score | 16 | Overall this is an amazing open-source project, with an easy and clear guide for developers to come aboard. I just do not know yet if it is the project for me.|
