| User Base | 2 | There are 4.7k forks and 25.9k stars on the repo in github, which shows this project is quite popular, as well as having a whole [book](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/data-structures-algorithms-in-swift) associated with the topic. |
| Total Score | 16 | This project is not nearly as active as the other two I researched, it is much more in line with what I want to learn this semester. Not only is this repository in the language I am looking for, but also it was made for educational purposes.|

<b> An In Depth Analysis of Swift Algorithm Club  </b>
</p>
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going into this semester, I wanted to learn a new language and decided that Swift would be that language. I did not want to limit myself by only choosing projects that were in Swift to research, so I picked my favorite Swift project and two others that were drastically different. Of the three projects chosen, Submitty, TensorFlow, and Swift Algorithm Club, the former two received the same sixteen points on the rubric given by the foss2serve [rubric](http://foss2serve.org/index.php/Project_Evaluation_Rubric_(Activity)). Submitty and TensorFlow both lost points for the same reason. They were too big and in a language I either am unfamiliar with or do not want to work with this semester. On the other hand, Swift Algorithm Club only lost a point for being relatively inactive in the past year. Due to Swift Algorithm Club receiving the highest score as well as being in the language I would like to learn, I chose it for my in-depth analysis. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing I had to do when choosing a project was to ensure there was a license for it guaranteeing it to be either free or open source. Swift Algorithm Club has the [MIT License](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) as their chosen license. This license is the standard permissive license. It allows the user nearly full rein to use the software however they please. Since it is a permissive license, it allows for the production and issue of closed source material. There are only two stipulations associated with the MIT License. The first being that if anyone uses the licensed software in a significant way, they are obligated to include the copyright notice and the license with their adapted code base. The second stipulation is there is a limitation on liability and no warranty. Since there is no warranty, there is no guarantee of the quality of the project. By no means does this mean the project was written poorly, but rather, the developers cannot be held accountable in a court of law if the code does not fully do what it is promised. The limitation on liability ensures that if this software or future iterations of it cause any damage, the developers cannot be found legally responsible. More information can be found here.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift Algorithm Club is a unique open source project in that it is completely centered around a single language. Most open source projects pull in multiple languages. Not only is this project completely centered around a language, it is set up to teach the language. This was optimal for me as I am hoping to learn Swift, so this was a helpful repository to find regardless of this assignment. For all their algorithms they have a detailed explanation of the algorithm itself and then how to implement such an algorithm in Swift. Looking at the simple insertion sort algorithm, they have an entire [readme](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/Insertion%20Sort/README.markdown) in markdown explaining in detail how the algorithm works. Starting off with two lists, unsorted and empty, then placing each element from the unsorted list into the empty list in order. Then it explains how to accomplish the same thing with a single list called an in-place sort. Then finally showing how the code works in Swift.  <br />

```swift
func insertionSort(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var sortedArray = array			 // 1
    for index in 1..<sortedArray.count {		 // 2
        var currentIndex = index
        while currentIndex > 0 && sortedArray[currentIndex] < sortedArray[currentIndex - 1] { // 3
            sortedArray.swapAt(currentIndex - 1, currentIndex)
            currentIndex -= 1
        }
    }
    return sortedArray
}
```
> Insertion sort function implemented in Swift
```swift
let list = [ 10, -1, 3, 9, 2, 27, 8, 5, 1, 3, 0, 26 ]
insertionSort(list)
```
Calling insertion sort on a list <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of depth is not just found in the beginner algorithms, all algorithms have a well-written readme explaining the algorithm as well as how it works in Swift. All in all, the knowledge available in the repository is similar to the knowledge base found in your everyday textbook. The reason behind this is that the owner of the repository, Ray Wenderlich, is an author himself. Ray Wenderlich is the founder of [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) (go figure), which is a coding tutorial website. Not only is he the owner of a teaching website he has written a book on the subject called [Data Structures and Algorithms in Swift](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/data-structures-algorithms-in-swift). <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite how great this repository is, the only drawback is that it is no longer very popular, at least for developers. This chart shows a clear slow down in the amount of commits over time. The project started off very strongly in 2016, but since then it has lost its steam. By no means does this mean that this project is finished, more likely that its developers have just moved on to different things. This will not stop me or anyone from contributing as the manager of the repository still seems to be active. <br />

Top twenty authors, ordered by lines of code committed <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the top twenty top authors on the project fourteen of them had their last commit in 2017. While the data shows how the main contributors have long since left the project, Kelvin Lau seems to be keeping the repository alive. Although Kelvin has not written the most number of lines for the project, he more than doubles the number of commits as the developer who has the second most, Matthijs Hollemans. Since Kelvin has been active this year as well as handling pull requests in the past, it gives me great confidence that any contributions I may make will get added to the repository. <br />
